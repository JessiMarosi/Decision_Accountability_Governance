# Decision Accountability Is the Missing Control

This repository contains a governance white paper examining why security programs operating in regulated and high-consequence environments can meet formal compliance requirements while continuing to experience audit findings, incident scrutiny, and leadership transition failures.

The paper argues that these outcomes are not primarily caused by missing controls, insufficient tooling, or poor implementation. Instead, the persistent failure mode is the loss of decision rationale over time. When the reasoning behind critical security decisions is not preserved, systems become difficult to explain, defend, and govern, even when they remain technically compliant.

The analysis draws on operational experience across long-lived systems shaped by mission demands, legacy dependencies, and institutional oversight. It examines how compliance frameworks emphasize control presence while leaving decision context implicit and fragile, creating a recurring disconnect between compliance and defensibility.
